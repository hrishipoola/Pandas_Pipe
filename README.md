# Pandas Pipe

I first came across pandas pipe last month at a [Berlin Time Series Analysis meetup](https://github.com/juanitorduz/btsa) and in a [TDS post](https://towardsdatascience.com/cleaner-data-analysis-with-pandas-using-pipes-4d73770fbf3c). It's a great way to organize and streamline your code and automate multiple dataframe manipulations and visualizations, especially if you're working with many dataframes. I wish I had used it more before! 

In a nutshell, pipe chains together operations, taking a dataframe-returning function or plot call and positional arguments as inputs. Let's demonstrate with a head-to-head comparison. Well first scrape Berlin district-level covid case data from [Das Landesamt f√ºr Gesundheit und Soziales](https://www.berlin.de/lageso/gesundheit/infektionsepidemiologie-infektionsschutz/corona/tabelle-bezirke-gesamtuebersicht/). We'll then perform several dataframe manipulations without and with pipe.
